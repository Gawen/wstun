# wstun

`wstun` is a Python script which connects an tun/tap IP tunnel to a WebSocket, giving the ability to deal with IP or Ethernet packets in a browser.

## Why?

I don't know.

## No but ... seriously?

For the beautiz ! Connect two worlds which does not overlap. I have no doubt this is not something to be used in a "industrial" world, but I suppose some hackers would enjoy playing with IP, TCP and UDP with Javascript runned in a browser.
